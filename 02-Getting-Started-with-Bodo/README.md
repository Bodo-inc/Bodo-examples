# Module 02- Getting Started with Bodo
Welcome to the 2nd module. This module contains Bodo Tutorials and best practices to use Bodo!

You can use [Bodo Platform](platform.bodo.ai) and follow the descriptions. Start with [01-bodo_getting_started.ipynb](01-bodo_getting_started.ipynb) and then [02-bodo_tutorial.ipynb](02-bodo_tutorial.ipynb).

You also have the option to run this example locally on your machine. But you need to go through some installation processes. First you need to [install bodo in a virtual environment](https://docs.bodo.ai/2022.7/installation_and_setup/install/) and then [install ipyparallel](https://docs.bodo.ai/2022.7/installation_and_setup/ipyparallel/) for interactive use, like when you are using a jupyter notebook. 
First make sure you have Bodo [installed](https://docs.bodo.ai/installation_and_setup/install/) by following the commands below.
Bodo can be installed using Conda. To view tutorials with Jupyter Notebook, install `jupyter` and `ipyparallel` in the same enviroment where Bodo is installed.
