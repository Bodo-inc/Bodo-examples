# Bodo Fundamentals

The Jupyter notebooks in this folder are materials for a Bodo Fundamentals course aimed at data engineers and scientists.

The file `environment.yml` describes a minimal conda environment that can execute the notebooks. One important package is RISE which enables viewing the notebooks in a slide presentation format.

The Bodo fundamentals training contains 7 modules. Take your time, start from module 01, and enjoy learning Bodo!

You can run these examples and learn for free on [Bodo Platform](https://platform.bodo.ai/)!
