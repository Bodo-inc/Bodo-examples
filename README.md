# Let's Learn Bodo through Examples!

Welcome to Bodo! If you are here, that means you have heard about the next generation of high performant big data programming using Bodo. You are in the right place to get started!

Bodo is the next generation of compute engines that brings supercomputing-style performance and scalability to native Python and SQL codes automatically. Bodo has several advantages over other big data transformation systems that helped it stand out as one of the most performant and cost-effective ETL tools. 

This repository teaches you how to become a professional bodo programmer from A to Z. Think of Bodo as SQL and Python, no new language or API is required to be learned. You will just `import bodo` and learn some programming tricks to promote your existing applications and help your organizations save on compute resources while delivering value in a much shorter period. Bodo is proven to be [one order of magnitude faster](https://www.bodo.ai/blog/performance-and-cost-of-bodo-vs-spark-dask-ray) than its competitors like Spark. 

We recommend you to run these examples on [Bodo Platform](https://platform.bodo.ai/account/sign-up). Just sign up for free to try. Some examples like modules 1 to 6 require a small clusters, e.g., 2 nodes of c5.2xlarge with total of 8 physical cores (16 vCPU) and 32GB RAM, and some examples need larger clusters. The description on top of each example explain what size of a cluster is required. For any size larger than 2 nodes c5.2xlarge, you can run at no Bodo charge within 14 days of sign up, but you or your organization would need to pay for AWS or Azur resources. After 14 days, you would incur bodo charges in addition to your cloud provider charges. But no worries, if you need more time, please reach us at [Contact Us](https://www.bodo.ai/contact) to extend that period for you. 

You can also run these examples locally using Bodo Community Edition, but it is not recommended as you need to go through some [installation process](https://docs.bodo.ai/2022.7/installation_and_setup/install/#install) while everything is already ready for you at https://platform.bodo.ai.


## Modules outline

You will first learn about the fundamentals of high performance computing using Python and Bodo in module 01. 

Then you will learn more coding tricks and styles to write your bodo code in the best way possible in module 02. 

Modules 3 and 4 focus on Bodo's sweet spot, meaning ETL applications. You will find examples with operational databases like PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, a data warehouse like Snowflake in module 04, and a data Lakehouse example with Iceberg in module 05. 

You can then run more use case examples in module 06. Module 7-9 contain larger scale examples with Machine Learning, Business use cases (financial, transportation, etc.). Module 09 demonstrates a head-to-head competition with Spark, Dask and Ray. And finally module 10 contains more advanced topics like deploying bodo applications in kubernetes, containers, streamlit, or on your cloud provider through Terraform (AWS and Azure).
