# Module 02- Getting Started with Bodo
Welcome to the 2nd module. This module contains Bodo Tutorials and best practices to use Bodo!

<<<<<<< HEAD
You can use [Bodo Platform](platform.bodo.ai) and follow the descriptions. Start with [01-bodo_getting_started.ipynb](01-bodo_getting_started.ipynb) and then [02-bodo_tutorial.ipynb](02-bodo_tutorial.ipynb).

You also have the option to run this example locally on your machine. But you need to go through some installation processes. First you need to [install bodo in a virtual environment](https://docs.bodo.ai/2022.7/installation_and_setup/install/) and then [install ipyparallel](https://docs.bodo.ai/2022.7/installation_and_setup/ipyparallel/) for interactive use, like when you are using a jupyter notebook. 
First make sure you have Bodo [installed](https://docs.bodo.ai/installation_and_setup/install/) by following the commands below.
Bodo can be installed using Conda. To view tutorials with Jupyter Notebook, install `jupyter` and `ipyparallel` in the same enviroment where Bodo is installed.

=======
Go through the [Bodo_Quick_Start_Guide](https://docs.bodo.ai/latest/quick_start_platform) for steps to sign up to the platform and instructions on how to use Bodo Community Workspace. It also helps in understanding how to create new notebooks or run some example notebooks in the workspace.
    
Starting with [`bodo_getting_started.ipynb`](bodo_getting_started.ipynb). 
    This notebook will give detailed instructions on how to get started with Bodo platform. 
    It demonstrates on how Bodo automatically parallelizes and optimizes standard Python programs that make use of pandas and NumPy using small examples.
    It explains with help of an example on how to use Bodo JIT Decorater to run the code using Bodo and also illustrates the requirements. 
Then move on to [`bodo_tutorial.ipynb`](bodo_tutorial.ipynb).
    This document explains various aspects of Bodo like Parallel Execution Model, Parallel API's, Data Distribution, Distributed Diagnostics, Function Arguements and their Return Values, Passing Distributed Data to Bodo, Scattering Data, Gathering Data, Parallel I/O, Various types of Files Supported, Bodo Caching features like Location, Portability and Invalidation with Examples.
    It also explains some of the Advanced Features like Explicit Parallel Loops, Integration with non-Bodo APIs, Collections of Distributed Data.
    The document also explains some trouble shooting steps that can be followed in case of issues.
